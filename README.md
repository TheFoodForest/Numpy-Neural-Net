- [Sigmoid Activation NN](https://github.com/TheFoodForest/Simple-Neural-Net/blob/master/Sigmoid%20Activation%20NN.ipynb)
  -  A relatively simple NN feeding forward propogating backwards the errors to the adjust weights and biases at each layer using stochastic gradient decent.  The model is then trained and validated on Kaggle's infamous Titanic dataset, and Scikit-Learn's digit recognition data set.  An exersize in learning more about how Neural Networks function.
